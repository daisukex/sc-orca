# SC-ORCA
**Space Cubics Open-source Reliable Core Architecture**

## 1. Project Overview

This repository manages open-source RTL written in SystemVerilog under the name **SC-ORCA** (Space Cubics Open-source Reliable Core Architecture).
It includes IP cores, primitives, and Verification IP.

Space Cubics Inc. develops high-reliability computers designed to operate in harsh environments, including space.

We publish **SC-ORCA** as a collection of IP cores actually used in our On-Board Computer (OBC) along with our original design framework.
All IP cores registered in SC-ORCA are designed with space operation in mind, including countermeasures against Single Event Upset (SEU) and error correction circuits (ECC).
